## üëã About Me

Hi there! I‚Äôm Sai Varshini Thupakula, a software engineer who believes ‚Äúit works‚Äù is just the starting point, not the destination.

My world revolves around:

- Playing a central role in backend engineering, from designing resilient systems in Java and Spring Boot to deploying on RHEL and Linux environments and architecting data layers with MongoDB and SQL
- Diving into operating system upgrades, virtualization, containerization, and tuning enterprise deployments
- Crafting full-stack applications with React.js frontends and Node.js backends, bridging business needs with technical elegance
- I‚Äôve explored data visualization with BIRT and Tableau, tackled AI challenges like IBM WatsonX hackathons, and built DevOps pipelines with Jenkins, Docker, and Git
- And occasionally chasing rogue semicolons at 2 a.m. because they thought they could hide from me

I‚Äôm fascinated by the elegance of systems, whether it‚Äôs untangling kernel logs, fine-tuning middleware, or designing React components that keep users happy.

Code, to me, is storytelling: one commit at a time.

- Built a modular and customizable platform that adapted to diverse team requirements across IBM
- Recognized as **Best Intern Project** for its impact and adoption across multiple teams beyond the original use case
- Automated crucial test cases for the IBM Storage Protect Plus team, significantly reducing manual validation time during release cycles
- Contributed to enhancements in IBM‚Äôs Continuous Build Automation (CBA) framework, optimizing repeated tasks and processes for large-scale deployments
- Shadowed senior engineers during design and product architecture reviews, gaining insights into how scalable enterprise systems are envisioned and delivered

---

### **Machine Learning Intern | Verzeo**  
*Jun 2020 ‚Äì Aug 2020*

- Initiated and led a project to predict used car prices using real-world datasets, delivering a Random Forest model with 93% accuracy
- Benchmarked model performance against Decision Trees and Linear Regression to identify optimal algorithms for deployment
- Focused heavily on feature engineering to extract meaningful insights from raw datasets
- Participated in discussions on deployment planning and scalability, even if the solution wasn‚Äôt fully productized during the internship
- Documented findings and presented outcomes to both mentors and peers, turning complex technical insights into accessible knowledge for the team

## üî¨ Research

My research experience bridges technical rigor and real-world impact.

Under **Prof. Nagaratna P. Hegde** | Vasavi College of Engineering:

- **Automated Glaucoma Detection System**  
    Co-developed a diagnostic tool using CNN, SVM, and KNN, achieving 94% accuracy on the RIGA dataset of 2,664 retinal fundus images. Published in an international journal, this project aims to enable early glaucoma screening, potentially preventing vision loss in under-resourced areas.

- **Pest Prediction System**  
    Collaborated on developing an image-processing system to help farmers detect pests early, supporting agricultural productivity and sustainability.

- Assisted in designing lab modules for ML and image processing courses, performed literature reviews, curated datasets, and contributed to ongoing technical publications.
